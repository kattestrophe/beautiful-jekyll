Throwing used batteries into the trash can be bad for the earth, and illegal in CA.

> Batteries are considered hazardous because of the metals and/or other toxic or corrosive materials they contain. Batteries are potentially a valuable source of recyclable metal.

>Batteries are considered hazardous waste in California when they are discarded. This includes AAA, AA, C, D, button cell, 9-volt, and all other batteries, both rechargeable and single-use. All batteries must be recycled or taken to a household hazardous waste disposal facility, a universal waste handler (e.g., storage facility or broker), or an authorized recycling facility.

To help in my little way, if you live in the Meadowbrook Village community,
my dad and I can come pick up any battery waste you have and we will make a
weekly run to the recycling center.

You can begin pickup scheduling by texting:

## 95152GREEN (951-524-7336)

You will receive a text in reply that will lead you to an easy Google form.

We hope that having something like this handy will encourage community members
to text us instead of tossing the dead battery from the remote into the trash!

**Note:** We can only pickup every Saturday because of our schedules.
