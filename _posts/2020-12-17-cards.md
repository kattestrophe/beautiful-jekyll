This year was really hard on all of us kids with the pandemic. I didn't meet any of my friends all year! But I've been reading a lot. A [lot](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12Bho9I_qatFMoG1R_p0PCqYt_PDDJJSeS8DtVVrC4Vs/edit?usp=sharing)! It's so much fun.

And that's how I knew what I can do this holiday season. 

I learned about [cardzforkidz](https://cardzforkidz.org/) from school and decided to spend the holiday time putting together some bookmarks! Maybe a kid who's in hospital can use it for *their* reading. 

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-md-4">
    <div class="thumbnail">     
        <img class="img-responsive img-thumbnail" src="/img/cards1.jpg"/>
    </div>
  </div>
   <div class="col-md-4">
    <div class="thumbnail">     
        <img class="img-responsive img-thumbnail" src="/img/cards2.jpg"/>
    </div>
  </div>
   <div class="col-md-4">
    <div class="thumbnail">     
        <img class="img-responsive img-thumbnail" src="/img/cards3.jpg"/>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
<div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-12">
        <div class="thumbnail">     
            <img class="img-responsive img-thumbnail" src="/img/cards4.jpg"/>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>


I created a total of 78 bookmarks and we drove to a UPS and mailed them out today. They all say "Love, Nitara from CA". I hope whoever gets one really likes it.
